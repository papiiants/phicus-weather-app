# Test projecto from Phicus company

## Task
Develop a web application that allows you to obtain current weather information for any location in the world, using the public API of:
[OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/)

## Rules
The minimum data to be displayed on the screen will be:
- Location consulted
- Current weather conditions (sunny, cloudy, etc.)
- Current temperature
- Atmospheric pressure
- Relative humidity
- Visibility
- Wind information

Weather information must be displayed in the most graphic way possible, using iconography appropriate for the different possible states.
In addition, the web application must allow you to store, in local persistence, a list of the consulted
locations and switch between them to display the weather information and forecast for the selected location.
